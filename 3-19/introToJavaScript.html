    // When using JavaScript, you are constantly manipulating HTML elements.
    // The method of selecting an HTML element in your HTML looks as follows:
    document.getElementById("text");
    // This code selects the HTML element with the ID of text that's located in your HTML document.


    // When programming you often create variables to contain data.
    // In Javascript you create variables using either var, const, and let, 
    // followed by the name of the variable and then what it is equal to, and closed with a semicolon.
    // For example
    var example = "This is an example of a string variable!";
    const PI = 3.14159;
    let javascriptIsNeat = true;

    // These variables can be used in your program repeatedly to get a lot of cool results.
    // There are several types of data that variables can contain, but the main we will focus on are:
    /*
        1. String - Represents a sequence (or string) of characters. Often contains words.
        2. Number - Stores numbers to be used for arithimetic operations.
        3. Boolean - Used to define whether a condition is true or false.
        4. Null - Represents a non-existing object, basically means the variable is empty.
        5. Undefined - This means the variable has been declared, but has not yet been defined.        
        6. Object - A collection of properties assigned to one variable. 
    */

    // We can combine the two concepts just learned to also create variables out of our HTML elements.
    const ourParagraphElement = document.getElementById("string");

    // Now we can resuse this object over and over again, and change it however we want.
    const sequenceOfCharacters = "asdfjkl;"
    ourParagraphElement.innerHTML = sequenceOfCharacters;
    ourParagraphElement.style.color = "red";
    ourParagraphElement.style.fontSize = "24px";
    ourParagraphElement.style.padding = "16px";

    // In JavaScript you can also create functions, which can be used to trigger responses to certain events.
    // Such as this function which will change what our example-text says whenever the button is pressed.
    function changeText() {
      document.getElementById("example-text").innerHTML = "Javascript";
    }

    // Another useful feature for testing your JavaScript code is the Console object.
    console.log("This is a message in your console");
    const a = 2;
    const b = 0;
    const c = 512;
    console.log(a/b);
    console.log(a*c);
    console.log(ourParagraphElement);
